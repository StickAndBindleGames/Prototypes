Hi, below is a list of small prototypes I've tinkered with in my limited spare time between 2015-2017. Everything is hastily thrown together: models, UI, features, code, etc. And should be viewed as an insight into my personal approaches to fleshing out game design, rather than my capabilities or professional work. They're all projects I threw together to see if I could find the fun in an idea and whether it'd be worth developing further. Some represent my early learning process of graphics and engine development, or the ins and outs of 3rd party engines. Some were made just to make my loved ones giggle. Someday, I hope to have the time to fully flesh out some of these ideas further. There's a lot more than shown here, but these are some of my favorites.

* This will become a table of contents (this text will be scraped).

## Tiny Haunter
You play as the ghosts of a house trying to scare away the largely clueless inhabitants. Would attempt to find humor in the oodles of kitchy horror tropes over the ages. 

## Tiny Revolt
You manage the inhabitants of a tabletop village trying to gain support and overthrow your tiny king. Would need to garner support for your cause, barricade alleyways, fight guards and eventually take over the castle.

## Anthill
You play as the destructive god over a bunch of little AI who just want to build stuff. The attempt was to have the AI learn from disaster and build in ways that would thrwart you. They'd develop offensive and defensive tech and architecture. Was initially an attempt to see if you could find fun in the things the AI made in response to your meddling.

## Tiny Robot
One of my first prototypes using Unity (I'll admit it shows). You play as a lonely little robot in the universe, crafting new ways to explore and survive. Lots of planned features I never found time for. Movement and graphics are still super janky in this one, but I still think it's cute.

## The Chosen Ones
This...was my own C++/OpenGL engine from the ground up (though, I eventually caved at soft-body physics and used the bullet physics engine). I was brand spanking new to programming and wanted to learn to create games. It creaks at the seams, but I learned a _ton_ about graphics and game programming. I still have nightmares of getting the bone rigging to work. :P  It was a rough time, but ultimately worth it. The game is essentially an infinite runner, but the AI just _goes_ and the player is tasked with keeping them alive via ropes, trampolines etc.
